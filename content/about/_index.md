## 👋
Hello, my name is Anthony Singhavong and I'm working full-time as an Engineering Manager at a cool company called [VSCO](https://vsco.co).
This blog details some fun (and not so fun) projects I'm working on either for pleasure or [academic duty](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/).

Hit me up on [linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asinghavong/) or [email me](mailto:asinghavong@gatech.edu) if you'd like to chat.
